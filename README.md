I am a former Doctor with years of experience in Orthopaedics, but now have decided to dedicate my career to Cyber Security. Skills vital to being a good clinician have and are helping me in my new found passion; such as fast descision making, critincal thinking, information recall and most of all understanding of the clients needs. 

## Objective


My journey began branching out into Law through a conversion course. The voulnerability and importance of Intellegence Law and Computer Safety I saw led me to develop a passion for cybersecurity, and I am now eager to transition into this field with full commitment. As well as always having a keen interest for computers! I have completed courses such as the Google Cyber Security Course, Infosec Threat Hunting, AWS cloud computing and Azure Foundations and AZ-900 courses. Through these courses I have found a passion for cloud security, knowing of it's vital importance to almost every facet of our lives; especially when looking to the future of technology. Currently I am studying for the MICROSOFT AZURE AZ-500 Security Engineer Certification, whilst continuing to learn Security Engineering within Amazon Web Services too - as I feel that having knowledge of both will broaden my career prospects in cloud computing cybersecurity. 

It is my dream to work within this specialized field, and learn directly from experts who already have years of experience at hand.
